# TU Dresden RoboLab Project
> Conducted by the Systems Engineering Group at the Department of Computer Science, TU Dresden. During the labs you are required to create Python programs for LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robots in order to solve several tasks. These so-called “bricks” are running a customized version of the Debian based operating system ev3dev-robolab. \
> RoboLab takes place in spring and summer during the lecture-free period after the examinations. The internship combines content from different areas of computer science in order to solve a complex task. Computer science problems are dealt with using practical programming tasks, programming skills are developed and further experience is gained in project and team work.

## Goal
Our aim was to work in groups of three to design, build and program a robot using the LEGO Mindstorm set. The robot was equipped with a light and colour sensor for navigation and a WIFI module to communicate with a server. The robot had to traverse planets, gathering information about the topology, using algorithms (e.g DFS, Dijsktra) to choose the most optimal path and also be flexible to avoid obstacles.

## Technologies
The equipment, software and hardware used were:
+ Python 3
+ LEGO MINDSTORMS Education EV3 Core Set (Hardware)
+ Publish-Subscribe network protocols (MQTT)
+ Linux (Debian-based OS, ev3dev-robolab)
+ Version control (Git)
+ Dijkstra algorithm, Depth-first search algorithm.
